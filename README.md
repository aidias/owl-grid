The Grid
---

A grid with 12 columns developed for OwlUI - an open-source library of UI components.
It's based on the flexbox properties. It has its unidirectional flow in an extremely easy and simple way to configure and use for creating responsive websites and applications.

#### Why use OWN-GRID?

The grid allows the quick and smooth creation of responsive applications precisely because it brings all the necessary functionalities, such as, all the `@media` queries configured for all device sizes available.

#### Why is it responsive?

We want our components to reach all audiences, and to be able to be supported by as many devices as possible, regardless of the orientation of the screen or its size.
